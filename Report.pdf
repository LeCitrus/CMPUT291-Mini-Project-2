a) tsv-2-json.py converts the four tsv files into json files with the same names with .json. The function will eventually return the output file 
with the exact same contents, but with "primaryProfession", "knownForTitles", "genres" and "characters" keys having its elements in a nested array. 
The output file with return in the correct directory and be ready to load.

load-json.py first asks for user input for the correct port number. It then sets up a connection with mongodb using pymongo and creates the four 
collections (name_basics, etc), as well we drop the collections if they already exist. Finally, we take the converted json files and load them into
mongodb. 

main.py has the simple query interface and all of phase 2 functionality. It gets a valid port number before going to the main menu.
The main menu has 6 options: the 5 tasks and exit program. For each task, the user follows the input prompts, then after the output is
printed the user presses enter to clear the screen and go back to the main menu. The main menu loops until the exit program option is selected.

b) tsv-2-json.py: takes the four files in the correct directory and loops with input file into the tsv2json function. This function creates
an array and strips each line in the file to create a dictionary of keys and values. For specific keys such as "primaryProfession" we used
.split(',') to turn them into nested arrays. As well, we used .strip() to get rid of \n at the end of element lists.

load-json.py: the function starts by asking user for a specific port number (the value accepted will be string). We use error handling to ensure
the user enters an integer rather than characters. We use this value to connect to a specific mongodb port using MongoClient(). We then created the 
database and named it 291db. Then we create the collections in the database and drop them if they already exist. Then we open the json file and store 
as file. Once it is loaded, we user insert_many() to insert into the mongodb collection. We repeat this process for all four collections and json files.

main.py: the main function begins by connecting to a valid mongoDB port, opening the correct database, and the 4 collections.
It then enters the main_menu while loop. Main menu prompt clears screen and lists the 6 options, prompting for input. 6 will break
the loop and end the program. 5 calls task_5(db, name_basics, title_basics, title_principals), which gets 

c) tsv-2-json functionality: the main focus was to check if the .json files were being properly created
and put in the correct directory/location. As well, we tested if the changes to the nested arrays were being made to the json files. As well,
we tested to make sure there were no "/n" elements at the end of lists. As well, we timed how long the program would take (11 seconds~). 

load-json functionality: the main focus was to check if the .json files were properly loaded into mongodb. We approached this through implementing
the code in chunks and checking our mongodb database each time to check if changes were being made. As well, another road block we ran into was 
ensuring we put could find the correct json files, we solved this through importing os and creating a file path. Another issue we ran into was duplicating
collection data, we realised we had forgotten to drop our collections at the start, and solved the issue.

phase 2 functionality: by creating a small dataset manually with enough
rows to provide informative output for tasks 3, 4, and 5.

d) Our group decided to split the project into 3 initial parts for the 3 members: each person worked on the 3 python files
in phase 1 and phase 2. We maintained that whoever finished their part first would help with the other parts, particularly phase 2
as that was the longest portion. 
Curtis worked on Phase 2 functionality, including the 5 tasks and the simple query interface. It took 
Clare worked on tsv-2-json.py, this section took about 3 hours to complete. After I finished tsv-2-json.py I helped with load-json.py and
was responsible for error handling and reducing processing time.
Seth worked on load-json.py

Finally, the whole group spent 5 hours on the last day to combine, debug, and refine the project files, including the read me and
report.pdf.
We kept the project on track by assigning the roles 2 weeks ahead of the deadline, giving frequent updates on gmail chats on progress
and problems. In the week that the project was due, we spent 10 hours on google meets to work on the project together so everyone
was on the same page.
